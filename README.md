# clebigdata-mar23
This is a repository for hosting my slides and associated documents for CLE Big 
Data Meetup (March 2023).

Source code for the slides (particularly to make the various graphs, since that
code wasn't visible in the presentation) can be found in `monte_carlo_lab.qmd`. 
I used [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to make all the files found in this repo.
